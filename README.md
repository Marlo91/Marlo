## Summary

Hey everyone! I wanted to share my journey of bridging philosophy, neuroscience, and now data science. During my PhD at the Berlin School of Mind and Brain, I delved deep into theoretical and methodological issues in consciousness research. As a philosopher trained in neuroscience, I was fascinated by how data could unlock new insights into the mind and brain. That's why I'm currently diving into a data science bootcamp at WBS Coding School—to equip myself with the skills to analyze human data and work on AI algorithms. My goal is to tackle some of the most intriguing questions in consciousness and cognition using data-driven approaches.

## Languages and Libraries Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries and Tools:** NumPy, pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Learnings

Embarking on this data science journey has been eye-opening. I've learned how to process and analyze complex datasets, which is crucial for exploring neural coding schemes and how our experiences are encoded in the brain. The bootcamp has enhanced my ability to apply machine learning algorithms to real-world data, bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications. I've also honed my ability to communicate technical insights clearly—a key skill when connecting fields like philosophy, neuroscience, and data science.

## Challenges Overcame

One of the biggest challenges was integrating my background in philosophy and neuroscience with the technical demands of data science. Concepts like the "neurophenomenal structuralism" needed to be translated into quantifiable models. This required creative problem-solving and a willingness to step out of my comfort zone. By collaborating with mentors and classmates, I found innovative ways to apply data science methodologies to philosophical and neuroscientific questions.

## Additional Reflections

This experience has reaffirmed my belief in the power of interdisciplinary collaboration. By combining data science with my background in philosophy and neuroscience, I'm opening up new avenues for understanding the mind and brain. I'm excited to continue this journey, using data science as a tool to dive deeper into human cognition and work on AI algorithms that could contribute to consciousness research. The possibilities are endless, and I can't wait to see where this path leads!
